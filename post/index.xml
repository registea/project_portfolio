      <description>Introduction The primary objective of this notebook is to explore the tidymodels predictive model framework. I am familiar with the caret package but as Max Kuhn has replaced caret with tidymodels and it has been available for a couple of years, I thought it a good time to take it for a test ride. To enable me to explore the framework a churn dataset provided by Shurti_lyyer on Kaggle will be used.</description>

      <description>Introduction This notebook explores the Predictive Power Score (PPS) filter method created by Florian Wetschoreck and posted on Medium. The article describes the PPS as a data type agnostic normalised score of predictive power. The example in the article provided was written in python, this notebook implements the PPS in R, via a custom function.
To explore the PPS, the house price prediction dataset from kaggle is used. This dataset is relatively large from a dimensional perspective but relatively small with regards to observations.</description>
